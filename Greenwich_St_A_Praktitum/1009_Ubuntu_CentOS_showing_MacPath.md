#### 早上: Ubuntu中disk(```/dev/sda1```)占用disk过多的问题;

#### Why running ```pytest``` in Terminal in Ubuntu/CentOS is showing Errors in Mac path?

Answer: Because you just drag the file directly from Mac. 

This repository is Private in Github, which means it's embedded in original Mac path. To duplicate this repo, ```git clone```
from Ubuntu host. To do this, add the ```id_rsa.pub``` into Github to make Github recognize this Ubuntu host.


Later: 

1. ```import astor```的问题: ```pip install astor```;
```astor```是python中的一个package;

2. ```NoModuleFoundError: pony.utils```. ??
