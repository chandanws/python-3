#### Why running ```pytest``` in Terminal in Ubuntu/CentOS is showing Errors in Mac path?

Answer: Because you just drag the file directly from Mac. 

This repository is Private in Github, which means it's embedded in original Mac path. To duplicate this repo, ```git clone```
from Ubuntu host. To do this, add the ```id_rsa.pub``` into Github to make Github recognize this Ubuntu host.
