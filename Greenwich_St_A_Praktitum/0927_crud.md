#### INSERT
``` 
INSERT INTO table1 (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES
    (value1, value2, ...),
    (value1, value2, ...),
    ... ;
```
e.g. 
```
CREATE TABLE artists_bachup(
    ArtistId INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Name NVARCHAR
);

INSERT INTO artists_backup
SELECT ArtistId, Name
FROM artists;
```

#### UPDATE
```
UPDATE table
SET column_1 = new_value_1,
    column_2 = new_value_2
WHERE
    search_condition
ORDER BY column_or_expr
LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset;
```

```LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset;```:  ```OFFSET``` is optional. If you use both ```LIMIT```
and ```OFFSET```, it first skips OFFSET rows, then apply the LIMIT constraints.

e.g. **Update w. ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses example**
```
UPDATE employees 
SET email =  LOWER(
    firstname || "." || lastname || @chinooncorp.com"
)
ORDER BY
    firstname
LIMIT 1;
```

e.g. **Update all rows example**
```
UPDATE employees
SET email = LOWER(
    firstname || "." || lastname || "@chinookcorp.com"
);
```

#### DELETE
```
DELETE FROM table
WEHRE search_condition
ORDER BY criteria
LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset;
```
### 注意 UNIQUE && DISTINCT 的区别: ```UNIQUE```一般作为主键的约束, ```DISTINCT```是select的条件;

#### REPLACE
The idea of ```REPLACE``` statement is that when a ```UNIQUE``` or ```PRIMARY KEY``` constraint
violation occurs, it does the following: 
1. First, **delete** the existing row that causes a constraint violation;
2. Second, **insert** a new row.
see the following example: [SQLite REPLACE statement examples](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-replace-statement/)

#### Transaaction
SQLite & ACID;
```
Atomic
Consistent: a transaction must ensure to change the DB from one valid state to another.
            When a transaction starts and executes a statement to modify data, the DB
            becomes inconsistent. However, when the transaction is committed or rolled back,
            it's important that the transaction must keep the database consistent.
Isolation: a pending transactin performed by a session must be isolated from other sessions.
           When a session starts a transaction and execute the INSERT or UPDATE statement
           to change the data, these changes are only visible to the current session,not others.
Durable: persistent to disk. When a transaction is successfully committed, the changes must be 
          permanent in the DB regardless of the condition such as power failure or program crash.
          On the other hand, if the program crashes before the transaction is committed, the change
          should not persist.
```

Begin transaction: 
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

commit changes to database:
```
COMMIT;
```

If you do not want to save these changes, you can roll back: 
```
ROLLBACK;
```

```
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
 
UPDATE accounts
   SET balance = balance - 1000
 WHERE account_no = 100;
 
UPDATE accounts
   SET balance = balance + 1000
 WHERE account_no = 200;
 
INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) 
VALUES(100,'-',1000,datetime('now'));
 
INSERT INTO account_changes(account_no,flag,amount,changed_at) 
VALUES(200,'+',1000,datetime('now'));
 
COMMIT;
```
